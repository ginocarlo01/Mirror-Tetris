# Mirror Tetris

## ✔️ Overview   
This game was developed for the purpose of studying JavaScript. 

Additionally, by modifying the original mechanics of Tetris, a comprehensive understanding of the code became essential.

If you want to know more about Mirror Tetris, there is a PDF Files that explain the logic of the system.

Here a brief explanation:

"The mirrored Tetris has a significant feature that completely alters the original game. It includes an additional set of tetrominoes, with distinct colors from the original ones. When you clear a line that contains at least one of these 'special' tetrominoes, the entire game state is reversed. If you move to the right, the game moves to the left, and the game board itself also undergoes inversion."
